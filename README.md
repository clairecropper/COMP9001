# The Python Project Challenge - Project Outline
In the Python Project Challenge, you will bring your ideas to life by designing and developing your own Python program! Whether it's solving a real-world problem or automating a task, this is your chance to turn your creativity into code and apply everything you've learned in an innovative way. This Project simulates the process of pitching your app idea to attract users and gain investment in the real world. 

As part of the Final Project you must implement various programming concepts you have learned throughout COMP9001. At this stage you should have learnt enough programming concepts to be able to develop a program which users can find valuable. 

# Late for Lecture

Late for Lecture is a fast-paced side-scrolling runner game where you play as Professor Ishac or Professor Chitizadeh
who’s running late to COMP9001 Lecture. You’ve lost track of time, and now you must sprint across campus, dodging swooping magpies 
and students while dealing with unpredictable rainstorms with drifting umbrellas.

Make it to class before the clock hits 5:00 PM, or you're officially late for lecture.

## Features
- Character selection screen with animated previews
- Rain system with fade-in and fade-out transitions
- Animated umbrella hazards that appear only during storms
- Students wandering the path as moving obstacles
- Dynamic difficulty that increases game speed based on your score
- Birds that flap and change vertical position as they pass
- High score tracking

## How to Play
You're a professor on a mission to make it to class on time.
Run forward, jump over obstacles, and survive as long as you can.

Avoid:
- Birds flying across the screen
- Umbrellas drifting in during rain
- Students wandering across the path

If you hit any obstacle, you're late! You then must make the decision to quit and cancel lecture, or start over and keep running.

## Controls
Spacebar – Jump

C – Choose your character

Any Key – Start the game (after character selection)

ESC – Quit the game during the Game Over screen

# Installation Instructions
## 1. Clone (or Download) the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/clairecropper/COMP9001.git
```
```
cd Final_Project
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment (recommended)

```
python -m venv .venv
```

## 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only required dependency is pygame, but the requirements.txt ensures version consistency in development.
