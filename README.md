# The Python Project Challenge - Project Outline
In the Python Project Challenge, you will bring your ideas to life by designing and developing your own Python program! Whether it's solving a real-world problem or automating a task, this is your chance to turn your creativity into code and apply everything you've learned in an innovative way. This Project simulates the process of pitching your app idea to attract users and gain investment in the real world. 

As part of the Final Project you must implement various programming concepts you have learned throughout COMP9001. At this stage you should have learnt enough programming concepts to be able to develop a program which users can find valuable.
